# Privacy Policy

## Data Collected

Nirvana Bot may store or temporarily cache the following types of non-sensitive, public data:

* Discord IDs (User, Guild, Channel, Role)
* Server configuration (prefixes, custom settings)
* User preferences (e.g., saved volume, 24/7 mode)
* Music-related metadata (e.g., song queue, playback time)
* Moderation logs (e.g., warnings, bans, command history)

No private messages (DMs) are read or logged.

## Purpose of Data

Data is collected strictly to enable the botâ€™s core features:

* Music playback and management
* Server-specific configuration
* Moderation tracking and audit logs
* Utility feature support

We do not sell or share data with third parties.

## Data Updates

Data may be updated when users interact with commands (e.g., setting preferences, saving queues, issuing moderation actions). All changes are logged in accordance with standard Discord bot operation practices.

## Temporary Caching

Some data may be temporarily cached for performance reasons. Cached data is typically cleared when:

* The bot restarts
* The bot is removed from a server
* A feature requiring it is disabled

## Data Deletion

You may request data deletion via the [support server](https://discord.gg/R35fpSXCR3). For security purposes:

* Only server owners may request deletion of server-related data
* Proof of identity (e.g., matching Discord ID) may be required for user data

Please note: basic Discord identifiers (e.g., user ID, guild ID) may still be retained for statistical, audit, or anti-abuse purposes.
